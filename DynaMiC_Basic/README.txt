DynaMiC_Basic

This repository contains one "DynaMiC_Basic" project. DynaMiC_Basic is a software tool of the family "Grid ENergy Intelligence µ-grid Solutions (GENIµS)" for the control of a community-based microgrid. 

DynaMiC_Basic is the basic version which is released here. The advanced version with dynamic boundary control functions will be released later. 

DynaMiC_Basic is developed in LabVIEW and implemented in CompactRIO. It requires the following libraries to execute:  
LabVIEW 2016
LabVIEW real-time 2016 
Labview DNP3
Labview mathscript
Labview FTP
C-RIO (CompactRIO) module
Labview advance signal processing toolkit
Labview watchdog timer
