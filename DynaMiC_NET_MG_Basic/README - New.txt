DynaMiC_Basic

This repository contains one "DynaMiC_Basic" project and one "DynaMiC_NET_MG_Basic". 

DynaMiC_Basic is a software tool of the family "Grid ENergy Intelligence µ-grid Solutions (GENIµS)" for the control of single community-based microgrid.

DynaMiC_NET_MG_Basic is the enhanced version of DynaMiC_Basic, providing for  control of networked microgrids.

Both DynaMiC_Basic and DynaMiC_NET_MG_Basic can be augmented with proprietary software to support dynamic boundary control. (See Application Guideline Section 2.2 User Access Levels for guidance on dynamic boundary functions and software availability.)

DynaMiC_Basic and DynaMiC_NET_MG_Basic are both developed in LabVIEW and implemented on a generic-purpose hardware platform – National Instruments CompactRIO. They require the following libraries to execute:
LabVIEW 2016
LabVIEW real-time 2016 
LabVIEW DNP3
LabVIEW mathscript
LabVIEW FTP
C-RIO (CompactRIO) module
LabVIEW advance signal processing toolkit
LabVIEW watchdog timer
